# Difference Between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases
## RDBMS 
● Data stored in a relational model, with rows and columns <br>
● Follows a fixed schema <br>
● Supports vertical scaling <br>
● Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) compliant <br>

## NoSQL
● Data stored in a host of different databases—each with different data storage models <br>
● Follows dynamic schemas <br>
● Supports horizontal scaling <br>
● Is not ACID complaint <br>
