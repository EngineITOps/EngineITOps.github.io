# What is NoSQL?and Difference Between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases

1.Not Only SQL (NoSQL) is a new set of database that is not based on the Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) principles.<br>
2.NoSQL was introduced by Carl Strozzi in 1998 to name his file-based database.<br>
3.NoSQL represents a group of products and a various related data concepts for storage and management of large data sets.<br>

NoSQL databases can have some common set of features such as:<br>
● Non-relational data model <br>
● Runs well on clusters <br>
● Mostly open source <br>
● Build for new generation web applications <br>
● Is schema-less <br>

# Difference Between RDBMS and NoSQL Databases
## RDBMS 
● Data stored in a relational model, with rows and columns <br>
● Follows a fixed schema <br>
● Supports vertical scaling <br>
● Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) compliant <br>

## NoSQL
● Data stored in a host of different databases—each with different data storage models <br>
● Follows dynamic schemas <br>
● Supports horizontal scaling <br>
● Is not ACID complaint <br>
